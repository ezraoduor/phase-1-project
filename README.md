 ## Movie Search & Favorites App
Welcome to the Movie Search & Favorites App – a fully functional JavaScript-based movie search application that allows users to search for movies, add favorites, and even contribute new movies. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, while the backend is powered by JSON Server, which can be hosted on Vercel to provide a mock REST API.

This project is designed for developers who want to explore fetching data from an API, handling user interactions, and persisting data dynamically without using a database.


## Features
This movie search application comes with the following functionalities:

✅ Dynamic Movie Search – Users can search for any movie using a search box. The app filters through available movies dynamically.

✅ Movie List – A curated list of movies is available by default, allowing users to browse through various titles.

✅ Add to Favorites – Users can click a button to save their favorite movies in a favorites list.

✅ Remove from Favorites – Users can remove any movie from the favorites list with a single click.

✅ Add New Movies – Users can add custom movies to the database. The new movies persist thanks to the JSON Server API.

✅ Data Persistence – All movie data is managed through a JSON file, acting as a database. When a user adds or removes a movie, the changes are saved.

✅ Netflix-Style UI – The interface is designed to mimic Netflix, giving users a familiar and modern experience.

✅ Backend with JSON Server – Uses a mock REST API to store and retrieve movie data without requiring a traditional database.

✅ Easy Deployment with Vercel – The backend can be deployed on Vercel, making the API accessible from anywhere.
